# What is a Startup?

"Startup" is a term first recorded in [1976](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/11/17/startup-language-idea/) to describe a small, young company with high growth potential. These companies typically leverage technology as an advantage in the market, allowing them to upset or circumvent larger competitors. For example, AirBnb is upsetting the traditional hotel market by allowing guests to book rooms directly with homeowners. Their software and the foundational technology that is now available (ie: the internet) allows them to keep transactions secure and renters safe without the overhead of actually owning expensive property or hiring hourly staff to clean and administer hotels. 

Technology startups may also create solutions to problems so unlike the current solutions that we credit them with making completely new markets. For example, very few people used a "social network" that looked anything like Facebook or Twitter to keep in touch with friends and family before the year 2000. There were "old media" solutions, but the base of technology required for widespread online social networks didn't exist before that time. Once it did, hundreds of competing social networking startups were launched and a new type of business took form.

While my personal experience is in software, startups aren't limited to that medium. Technology hardware startups created personal computers that acted as the "[first wave](https://venturebeat.com/2016/07/10/what-steve-cases-third-wave-means-for-global-startups/)" in the modern startup movement. These early hardware startups enabled software platforms which in turn enabled internet-connected services to take hold, but hardware startups are far from passe. Advances in "wearable" technology in the late 2000's were largely led by startups like Fitbit and Jawbone before being adopted by larger companies like Apple and Samsung. Even today, hardware startups are playing a huge role in the improvement of 3D printing, unmanned flying vehicles, and self-driving cars. The integration of hardware and software at most of these companies has spawned a new world of valuable and exciting opportunities.

The problem with startups is that we often don't hear of them until they are no longer truly startups. Many of the companies I mentioned above are publicly traded or have market values in the billions of dollars (commonly referred to as "[unicorns](http://www.ibtimes.com/real-reason-everyone-calls-billion-dollar-startups-unicorns-2079596)"). While I use some examples in this book from companies that are now recognizable names, I'm not writing this book for product developers and engineers who work at billion-dollar startups. For this reason, I've chosen to make an important distinction: this book is about product development at "early stage startups."

## What does an early stage startup look like?

Early stage startups have not yet found [product/market fit](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee204/ProductMarketFit.html). That means that while the company may have a vision, may have identified a problem, or may have started learning about its market, they are not yet sure exactly how their solution will work or if it will work in a profitable way. Early stage startups are typically experimenting, building prototypes, and talking to customers to get feedback. They're in the "pre-scaling" phase; they need more validation before they can take on large amounts of funding and scale up operations.

Typically early stage startups are either funded by investors (external parties who are willing to take a risk on the new venture in exchange for an ownership stake), by debt (less common for a startup than a traditional small business, but sometimes founders take personal debt to fund their companies), or by the founders (either from their pockets or through "[sweat equity](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sweatequity.asp)").

It's important to note that "early" is a relative term. In a hardware or pharmaceutical startup, you may need to raise millions of dollars just to build a prototype and test it. In a software startup, you probably just need a few thousand dollars or a few hours of your own time to get going.

While there aren't hard rules about what is an early vs. mid-stage startup, there are some indicators you can use to help determine where your company might fit. Indicators of an early stage startup include:

- Fewer than 10 full-time employees.
- No funding or just a "seed" funding round.
- The founders are extremely involved in execution, not management.
- Some or all of the employees are foregoing a salary and working for mostly or all equity.
- The business has very few paying customers and mostly "pilot" or "trial" customers.
- The product team is fewer than 5 full-time employees.

Throughout this book, I'll use the term "startup" and "early stage startup" interchangeably. Just note that unless specified, this book is exclusively about early stage startups. Some of the advice I offer here will work as your company scales up, but some of it probably won't hold up. Office politics, management strategies, organizational charts, and product development are all very different when the founders have their own office than when they sit next to the interns.

## How are "startups" different from small businesses?

The term "startup" is thrown around pretty liberally now. I often hear it used to refer to any small business, and in many ways, the distinctions are minimal. Many organizations that start their lives as startups morph into small businesses, and a few small businesses evolve into startups at some point. The key distinction is scaling potential. [According to Steve Blank](http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2011/09/01/why-governments-dont-get-startups-or-why-theres-only-one-silicon-valley/?single_page=true#) - one of Silicon Valley's most well known venture capitalists,
 
> "Scalable startups are what Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and their venture investors aspire to build...From day one, the founders believe that their vision can change the world. Unlike small business entrepreneurs, their interest is not in earning a living but rather in creating equity in a company that eventually will become publicly traded or acquired, generating a multi-million-dollar payoff."

I don't think that startups' big vision makes them "better" than small businesses, and I don't think that their high failure rate makes them "worse" either. While their _potential_ economic impact may be bigger, most startups never get the chance to materialize into something that "changes the world."

## Why do people want to work at a startup?

It's pretty clear that work at a startup can be exciting. If it takes off, founders and early employees can gain celebrity status, and anyone with a slice of equity will probably get very rich. I know that appealed to me early on in my career. I didn't start planning for retirement [until my late 20's](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-retirement) because I figured that the equity I had in one of my startups was bound to be worth a few million dollars some day.

While I'm not as naive anymore, I still love working at startups. Different things appeal to different people, but I think the most common perks are:

### Potential impact

It's hard to overstate how exciting it is believing that your work will help create a completely new market or pave the way for thousands of new jobs in the future. People who can see a startup's potential impact can lose sight of everything else - including whatever they're giving up.

### Idealism

I believe that most people who spend careers in large organizations like the government or publicly traded companies eventually get jaded. Bureaucracy kills innovation and idealism, but startups can (and usually do) live by strict, idealistic codes. Google's first corporate motto was "[Don't be evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil)." You don't see mottos like this in most large corporations.

### Role

You might be a big fish in a tiny pond at a startup, but you'll definitely get a bigger role than you would at a large company. I started my first company in college, and while that little startup never got off the ground, I joined another startup after graduation with the title "Director of News," even though the scope of my "direction" was just a handful of interns.  

### Equity

"Equity" means an ownership stake in the company, and most startups will offer some equity to early employees in lieu of some or all of their cash compensation. Deciding how to value a startup's equity is difficult, especially in an early stage startup, but I'll just say that I view equity like playing the lottery: if you've got the financial footing to take the risk, it's fine, but don't skip meals just to buy a ticket.

### Flexibility

Another substitute that startups will offer for cash compensation is flexibility. While some of large companies offer work-from-home options, almost every early stage startup lets its employees dictate the terms of their workplace. You might even get "unlimited vacation," although it's probably a good idea to plan on all vacations being "on-call" working vacations at a startup.

### Hype

Finally, there's a lot of hype surrounding startups right now. There's a startup podcast, a startup show on HBO, there have been lots of movies about well-known internet startups like Facebook, and it's hard to read a newspaper without hearing about some magical startup's _machine learning powered, artificial intelligence enabled, 3D printed drone_.

Before you buy into the hype, before you bank on the million dollar equity payout, read the next chapter in this book. Startups can be a great places to work, but as a product developer or engineer, you have a lot of options for where you can go. Make sure you're making the right decision for yourself before you venture into the startup world.
